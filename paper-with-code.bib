  abstract  = {Estimation of parameters of a diffusion based on discrete time observations poses a difficult problem due to the lack of a closed form expression for the likelihood. From a Bayesian computational perspective it can be casted as a missing data problem where the diffusion bridges in between discrete-time observations are missing. The computational problem can then be dealt with using a Markov-chain Monte-Carlo method known as data-augmentation. If unknown parameters appear in the diffusion coefficient, direct implementation of data-augmentation results in a Markov chain that is reducible. Furthermore, data-augmentation requires efficient sampling of diffusion bridges, which can be difficult, especially in the multidimensional case. We present a general framework to deal with with these problems that does not rely on discretisation. The construction generalises previous approaches and sheds light on the assumptions necessary to make these approaches work. We define a random-walk type Metropolis-Hastings sampler for updating diffusion bridges. Our methods are illustrated using guided proposals for sampling diffusion bridges. These are Markov processes obtained by adding a guiding term to the drift of the diffusion. We give general guidelines on the construction of these proposals and introduce a time change and scaling of the guided proposal that reduces discretisation error. Numerical examples demonstrate the performance of our methods.},

  abstract   = {Forward modeling is vital for 3D inversion and interpretation of electromagnetic (EM) data in anisotropic media, which is one of the major challenges in the field of EM geophysics. However, there are few freely available 3D codes that are capable of modeling EM responses in fully anisotropic media. In addition, most existing 3D EM codes are written in low-level languages (LLs) such as C and Fortran, making them difficult to read, maintain, and extend. Taking advantage of recent progress in computer technology and numerical methods, we have developed an open-source package for forward modeling of frequency-domain EM fields in a fully 3D anisotropic earth (EM3DANI) using the Julia language, a relatively young, high-level programming language with a focus on high performance. Based on a mimetic finite-volume discretization of the governing equations, the modeling algorithm is expressed in an abstract form in terms of matrices/vectors and thus can be easily implemented by using any high-level language commonly used for numerical computing. Existing libraries written in LLs can be easily integrated into a Julia code without the so-called two-language problem; thus, we have exploited several mature third-party packages to deal with computationally intensive parts of the forward modeling, which guarantees high stability and efficiency. We have elaborated the structure of the package, paying special attention to code usability, readability, and extendability, while striving to retain versatility and high performance. The effectiveness of the code is demonstrated through two 1D synthetic examples for magnetotelluric and controlled-source EM (CSEM) problems, respectively. High accuracy and efficiency can be achieved for both 1D examples. Furthermore, we have developed a 3D example mimicking a marine CSEM survey scenario for hydrocarbon exploration. The simulation results indicate that the effect of the anisotropy on forward responses is significant and can be comparable to that of the target reservoir.},

Assuming the disk and binary are co-planar within ～2°, this disk-based binary mass measurement is in excellent agreement with constraints from radial velocity monitoring of the combined stellar spectra. These ALMA results are also compared with the standard approach of estimating masses from the location of the binary in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, using several common pre-MS model grids. These models predict stellar masses that are marginally consistent with our dynamical measurement (at ～2σ), but are systematically high (by ～10\%). These same models consistently predict an age of 18 ± 1 Myr for AK Sco, in line with its membership in the Upper Centaurus–Lupus association but surprisingly old for it to still host a gas-rich disk. As ALMA accumulates comparable data for large samples of pre-MS stars, the methodology employed here to extract a dynamical mass from the disk rotation curve should prove extraordinarily useful for efforts to characterize the fundamental parameters of early stellar evolution.},

A forward modeling of the 13CO and C18O J = 2–1 transitions permits a measurement of the total stellar mass in this system, , and the circumtriple disk inclination, . Optical spectra spanning a 35 yr period were used to derive new radial velocities and, coupled with a spectroscopic disentangling technique, revealed that the A and B components of GW Ori form a double-lined spectroscopic binary with a period of 241.50 ± 0.05 days; a tertiary companion orbits that inner pair with a period of 4218 ± 50 days. Combining the results from the ALMA data and the optical spectra with three epochs of astrometry in the literature, we constrain the individual stellar masses in the system (, , ) and find strong evidence that at least one of the stellar orbital planes (and likely both) is misaligned with the disk plane by as much as 45°. A V-band light curve spanning 30 yr reveals several new ～30-day eclipse events 0.1–0.7 mag in depth and a 0.2 mag sinusoidal oscillation that is clearly phased with the AB–C orbital period. Taken together, these features suggest that the A–B pair may be partially obscured by material in the inner disk as the pair approaches apoastron in the hierarchical orbit. Lastly, we conclude that stellar evolutionary models are consistent with our measurements of the masses and basic photospheric properties if the GW Ori system is ～1 Myr old.},

Here we present a model for continuous cell culture coupling intra-cellular metabolism to extracellular variables describing the state of the bioreactor, taking into account the growth capacity of the cell and the impact of toxic byproduct accumulation. We provide a method to determine the steady states of this system that is tractable for metabolic networks of arbitrary complexity. We demonstrate our approach in a toy model first, and then in a genome-scale metabolic network of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, obtaining results that are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. We derive a number of consequences from the model that are independent of parameter values. The ratio between cell density and dilution rate is an ideal control parameter to fix a steady state with desired metabolic properties. This conclusion is robust even in the presence of multi-stability, which is explained in our model by a negative feedback loop due to toxic byproduct accumulation. A complex landscape of steady states emerges from our simulations, including multiple metabolic switches, which also explain why cell-line and media benchmarks carried out in batch culture cannot be extrapolated to perfusion. On the other hand, we predict invariance laws between continuous cell cultures with different parameters. A practical consequence is that the chemostat is an ideal experimental model for large-scale high-density perfusion cultures, where the complex landscape of metabolic transitions is faithfully reproduced.},

  abstract = {Lead halide perovskite semiconductors are soft, polar materials. The strong driving force for polaron formation (the dielectric electron-phonon coupling) is balanced by the light band effective masses, leading to a strongly-interacting large polaron. A first-principles prediction of mobility would help understand the fundamental mobility limits. Theories of mobility need to consider the polaron (rather than free-carrier) state due to the strong interactions. In this material we expect that at room temperature polar-optical phonon mode scattering will dominate and so limit mobility. We calculate the temperature-dependent polaron mobility of hybrid halide perovskites by variationally solving the Feynman polaron model with the finite-temperature free energies of Osaka. This model considers a simplified effective-mass band structure interacting with a continuum dielectric of characteristic response frequency. We parametrize the model fully from electronic-structure calculations. In methylammonium lead iodide at 300 K we predict electron and hole mobilities of 133 and 94 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), respectively. These are in acceptable agreement with single-crystal measurements, suggesting that the intrinsic limit of the polaron charge carrier state has been reached. Repercussions for hot-electron photoexcited states are discussed. As well as mobility, the model also exposes the dynamic structure of the polaron. This can be used to interpret impedance measurements of the charge-carrier state. We provide the phonon-drag mass renormalization and scattering time constants. These could be used as parameters for larger-scale device models and band-structure dependent mobility simulations.},

It covers discrete equations (function maps, discrete stochastic (Gillespie/Markov) simulations), ordinary differential equations, stochastic differential equations, algebraic differential equations, delay differential equations, hybrid differential equations, jump diffusions, and (stochastic) partial differential equations. Through extensive use of multiple dispatch, metaprogramming, plot recipes, foreign function interfaces (FFI), and call-overloading, DifferentialEquations.jl offers a unified user interface to solve and analyze various forms of differential equations while not sacrificing features or performance. Many modern features are integrated into the solvers, such as allowing arbitrary user-defined number systems for high-precision and arithmetic with physical units, built-in multithreading and parallelism, and symbolic calculation of Jacobians. Integrated into the package is an algorithm testing and benchmarking suite to both ensure accuracy and serve as an easy way for researchers to develop and distribute their own methods. Together, these features build a highly extendable suite which is feature-rich and highly performant.

In this paper, we consider the product line design problem when customers choose according to a first-choice rule and present a new mixed-integer optimization formulation of the problem. We theoretically analyze the strength of our formulation and show that it is stronger than alternative formulations that have been proposed in the literature, thus contributing to a unified understanding of the different formulations for this problem. We also present a novel solution approach for solving our formulation at scale, based on Benders decomposition, which exploits the surprising fact that Benders cuts for both the relaxation and the integer problem can be generated in a computationally efficient manner. We demonstrate the value of our formulation and Benders decomposition approach through two sets of experiments. In the first, we use synthetic instances to show that our formulation is computationally tractable and can be solved an order of magnitude faster for small- to medium-scale instances than the alternate, previously proposed formulations. In the second, we consider a previously studied product line design instance based on a real conjoint data set, involving over 3,000 candidate products and over 300 respondents. We show that this problem, which required a week of computation time to solve in prior work, is solved by our approach to full optimality in approximately 10 minutes.

  abstract   = {Weave is a tool for writing scientific reports using Julia (Bezanson et al. 2017). It allows writing of text, mathematics and code in a single document which can be run capturing results into a rich report. Output can include text using several markup languages, plots generated using one of the several Julia plotting libraries and other objects displayed using Julia’s multimedia output. The workflow is very similar to using Knitr (Xie 2015) R-package.

Weave supports noweb, markdown, script syntax for delimiting code from text in the source document and several output formats including Markdown and Latex. The output from code can be controlled using chunk options making it possible e.g. to hide code and only show output when needed as well as set a figure caption and figure size. The library also has methods for converting documents from all input formats to Jupyter notebooks and vice versa.

The package aims to support writing scientific papers and enable easy sharing of analysis in order to promote reproducible research. It also aims to enable simple writing of educational material, tutorials and blog posts.},

  abstract = {Bacteria of certain species communicate with each other to organise group-beneficial collective behaviour such as bioluminescence or swarming motility. The cell-to-cell communication of these bacteria is based on a cell-density dependent mechanism called quorum sensing (QS). For this process different mathematical models in the form of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), partial differential equations (PDEs), and delay differential equations (DDEs) have been proposed and studied in literature. In this thesis we consider a mathematical model of QS in {\textless}em{\textgreater}Pseudomonas putida{\textless}/em{\textgreater} IsoF ({\textless}em{\textgreater}P. putida{\textless}/em{\textgreater} IsoF) which was published by Buddrus-Schiemann et al. They conducted growth experiments of {\textless}em{\textgreater}P. putida{\textless}/em{\textgreater} IsoF under steady state conditions in a chemostat and could describe their measurements by a mathematical QS model of DDEs. We discuss the motivation of this model, building on well-known mathematical models for chemostat experiments and generic QS models. Moreover, we derive a modification of the QS model which accounts for subpopulations of {\textless}em{\textgreater}P. putida{\textless}/em{\textgreater} IsoF with different roles in the QS system. Buddrus-Schiemann et al. speculated about the existence of these subpopulations which could explain some of their surprising findings. After a short theoretical analysis of both QS models we investigate which numerical methods are suited for computing simulations of these models. We provide a general introduction to numerical DDE solvers and present DelayDiffEq.jl, an improved and rewritten DDE solver in Julia. The last part of this thesis is dedicated to the inverse problems of the QS models. We develop a suitable objective function for parameter estimation and apply regularization and global optimisation to deal with the ill-conditioning and non-convexity of the parameter estimation problem. Moreover, we determine structurally and practically non-identifiable parameters. Our parameter estimation yields slightly different parameter estimates that fit the experimental data better than the parameters published by Buddrus-Schiemann et al. However, the parameter estimates do not support the hypothesis of two subpopulations.},

These data can be thought of as a large matrix with covariates annotating both rows and columns of this matrix. Matrix linear models provide a convenient way for modeling such data. In many situations, sparse estimation of these models is desired. We present fast, general methods for fitting sparse matrix linear models to structured high-throughput data. We induce model sparsity using an L\$\_1\$ penalty and consider the case when the response matrix and the covariate matrices are large. Due to data size, standard methods for estimation of these penalized regression models fail if the problem is converted to the corresponding univariate regression scenario. By leveraging matrix properties in the structure of our model, we develop several fast estimation algorithms (coordinate descent, FISTA, and ADMM) and discuss their trade-offs. We evaluate our method's performance on simulated data, E. coli chemical genetic screening data, and two Arabidopsis genetic datasets with multivariate responses.

  abstract = {When the number of observations is large, it is computationally challenging to apply classical inverse modeling techniques. We have developed a new computationally efficient technique for solving inverse problems with a large number of observations (e.g., on the order of 107 or greater). Our method, which we call the randomized geostatistical approach (RGA), is built upon the principal component geostatistical approach (PCGA). We employ a data reduction technique combined with the PCGA to improve the computational efficiency and reduce the memory usage. Specifically, we employ a randomized numerical linear algebra technique based on a so-called “sketching” matrix to effectively reduce the dimension of the observations without losing the information content needed for the inverse analysis. In this way, the computational and memory costs for RGA scale with the information content rather than the size of the calibration data. Our algorithm is coded in Julia and implemented in the MADS open-source high-performance computational framework (http://mads.lanl.gov). We apply our new inverse modeling method to invert for a synthetic transmissivity field. Compared to a standard geostatistical approach (GA), our method is more efficient when the number of observations is large. Most importantly, our method is capable of solving larger inverse problems than the standard GA and PCGA approaches. Therefore, our new model inversion method is a powerful tool for solving large-scale inverse problems. The method can be applied in any field and is not limited to hydrogeological applications such as the characterization of aquifer heterogeneity.},

The appeal of CARM is that, in rather general situations, the approximate projections we employ are available under low computational cost. We derive convergence of CARM and linear convergence under an error bound condition. We also present successful theoretical and numerical comparisons of CARM to the original CRM, to the classical method of alternating projections (MAP), and to a correspondent outer-approximate version of MAP, referred to as MAAP.

Here, we describe a non-steady state physiological model developed to decouple CSF fluid transport from other processes. Kinetic parameters were estimated using: (1) MRI-derived brain volumes, (2) stable isotope labeling kinetics (SILK) of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), and (3) lumbar CSF Aβ concentration during SILK. Here we show that changes in blood-brain barrier transport and/or proteolysis were largely responsible for the age-related decline in Aβ turnover rates. CSF-based clearance declined modestly in normal aging but became increasingly important due to the slowing of other processes. The magnitude of CSF-based clearance was also lower than that due to blood-brain barrier function plus proteolysis. These results suggest important roles for blood-brain barrier transport and proteolytic degradation of Aβ in the development Alzheimer’s Disease in humans.},

The assessment of this enhancement is a computationally demanding task, with simulations taking hours or days to converge. Conventionally the source of the radiofrequency fields, patient anatomy, and the medical implant are simulated concurrently. To alleviate the computational burden, we reformulate a fast simulation method that views the medical implant as a small perturbation of the simulation domain without the medical implant and calculates the radiofrequency fields associated with this perturbation. Previously, this method required an extensive offline stage where the result is intractable for large simulation domains. Currently, this offline stage is no longer required and the method is completely online. The proposed method results in comparable radiofrequency fields but is orders of magnitude faster compared to standard simulation technique; the finite-difference time-domain, the finite-sums, and the finite element methods. This acceleration could enable patient-specific and potentially online radiofrequency safety assessment.},

  abstract  = {Background
In addition to heterogeneity and artificial selection, natural selection is one of the forces used to combat climate change and improve agrobiodiversity in evolutionary plant breeding. Accurate identification of the specific genomic effects of natural selection will likely accelerate transfer between populations. Thus, insights into changes in allele frequency, adequate population size, gene flow and drift are essential. However, observing such effects often involves a trade-off between costs and resolution when a large sample of genotypes for many loci is analysed. Pool genotyping approaches achieve high resolution and precision in estimating allele frequency when sequence coverage is high. Nevertheless, high-coverage pool sequencing of large genomes is expensive.

Results
Three pool samples (n = 300, 300, 288) from a barley backcross population were generated to assess the population's allele frequency. The tested population (BC2F21) has undergone 18 generations of natural adaption to conventional farming practice. The accuracies of estimated pool-based allele frequencies and genome coverage yields were compared using three next-generation sequencing genotyping methods. To achieve accurate allele frequency estimates with low sequence coverage, we employed a haplotyping approach. Low coverage allele frequencies of closely located single polymorphisms were aggregated into a single haplotype allele frequency, yielding 2-to-271-times higher depth and increased precision. When we combined different haplotyping tactics, we found that gene and chip marker-based haplotype analyses performed equivalently or better compared with simple contig haplotype windows. Comparing multiple pool samples and referencing against an individual sequencing approach revealed that whole-genome pool re-sequencing (WGS) achieved the highest correlation with individual genotyping (≥ 0.97). In contrast, transcriptome-based genotyping (MACE) and genotyping by sequencing (GBS) pool replicates were significantly associated with higher error rates and lower correlations, but are still valuable to detect large allele frequency variations.

Conclusions
The proposed strategy identified the allele frequency of populations with high accuracy at low cost. This is particularly relevant to evolutionary plant breeding of crops with very large genomes, such as barley. Whole-genome low coverage re-sequencing at 0.03 × coverage per genotype accurately estimated the allele frequency when a loci-based haplotyping approach was applied. The implementation of annotated haplotypes capitalises on the biological background and statistical robustness.},

  abstract   = {The evaluation of relativistic molecular integrals over exponential−type spinor orbitals requires the use of relativistic auxiliary functions in prolate spheroidal coordinates, and has been recently achieved (Bağcı and Hoggan (2015) [14]). This process is used in the solution of the molecular Dirac equation for electrons moving in a Coulomb potential. A series of papers on a method for fully analytical evaluation of relativistic auxiliary functions has been published [2, 3, 4] From the perspective of computational physics, these studies demonstrate how to deal with the integrals of the product of power functions with non−integer exponents and incomplete gamma functions. The computer program package used to calculate these auxiliary functions with high accuracy is presented. It is designed using the Julia programming language and yields highly accurate results for molecular integrals over a wide range of orbital parameters and quantum numbers. Additionally, the program package facilitates the efficient calculation of the angular momentum coefficients that arise from the product of two normalized Legendre functions centered at different atomic positions, and the determination of the rotation angular functions used for both complex and real spherical harmonics. Sample calculations are performed for two−center one−electron integrals over non−integer Slater−type orbitals, and the results prove the robustness of the package.

External routines/libraries: Nemo computer algebra package for the Julia programming language [6], Cuba multidimensional numerical integration using different algorithms in Julia [7]. Nature of problem: Relativistic molecular auxiliary function integrals result from the expression of a two−center two−electron Coulomb energy associated with a charge density. The Coulomb energy is transformed into kinetic energy integrals using Poisson's equation and the single−center potential, considering that the Laplace expansion for the Coulomb interactions is expressed in terms of normalized non−integer Slater−type orbitals [1]. Using the resulting expression for the two−center two−electron integrals, relativistic auxiliary function integrals are derived in prolate ellipsoidal coordinates. These auxiliary functions are generalized to the entire set of physical potential operators for the Coulomb potential case. The integral of the relativistic auxiliary functions have no closed−form solutions except that their parameters are integers. As such, the analytical evaluation of these functions is challenging. They are used in the solution of the matrix form representation of the molecular Dirac−Fock self−consistent field (SCF) equation. Solution method: A criterion that considers the symmetry properties of two−center two−electron molecular integrals is initially proposed [2]. This obviates the need for the computation of incomplete and complementary incomplete gamma functions, and utilizes their sum (P+Q=1). The resulting form of the integral of the relativistic molecular auxiliary functions is expressed in terms of the convergent series representation of incomplete beta functions. Recurrence relationships are then derived for each of these sub−functions [3]. The algorithm for computation of the auxiliary functions is based on the vectorization procedure defined in [4].

  abstract = {Covering the soil surface with mulch is a cropland management practice that can provide several benefits to the soil environment, especially in rainfed systems. Soil mulching tends to enhance plant growth by reducing soil evaporation and potentially increasing transpiration, but its effectiveness vary widely across rainfall regimes and mulching materials. Here we investigate this variability using a process-based modeling framework coupling the dynamics of soil and mulching moisture and of crop growth. Supported by field observations under different mulching materials, we study the effectiveness of soil mulching in increasing transpiration and growth under different rainfall regimes and mulching layer thickness. The analysis suggests that in most rainfall scenarios soil mulching can increase plant transpiration by up to 100\% and reduce soil evaporation by up to 40\%. However, there exist rainfall conditions (low frequency and high intensity) under which soil mulching may cause lower transpiration. We also show that soil mulching is particularly beneficial during a dry spell, a phenomenon that is projected to occur more frequently in many climatic zones. In the event of a dry spell during the growing season, soil mulching helps maintain moist conditions for longer, hence limiting the negative effects on plant transpiration and growth. The analysis helps better understand the role of soil mulching on transpiration and crop growth and provides important information for improving soil mulching depending on mulching material and the site-specific rainfall regime.},

  abstract   = {Astronomical optical interferometers sample the Fourier transform of the intensity distribution of a source at the observation wavelength. Because of rapid perturbations caused by atmospheric turbulence, the phases of the complex Fourier samples (visibilities) cannot be directly exploited. Consequently, specific image reconstruction methods have been devised in the last few decades. Modern polychromatic optical interferometric instruments are now paving the way to multiwavelength imaging. This paper is devoted to the derivation of a spatiospectral (3D) image reconstruction algorithm, coined Polychromatic opticAl INTErferometric Reconstruction software (PAINTER). The algorithm relies on an iterative process, which alternates estimation of polychromatic images and complex visibilities. The complex visibilities are not only estimated from squared moduli and closure phases, but also differential phases, which helps to better constrain the polychromatic reconstruction. Simulations on synthetic data illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm and, in particular, the relevance of injecting a differential phases model in the reconstruction.},

Achieving such flexibility in artificial systems is challenging, even with more and more computational power. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that abstraction and hierarchical information processing might in fact be the consequence of limitations in information-processing power. In particular, we study an information-theoretic framework of bounded rational decision-making that trades off utility maximization against information-processing costs. We apply the basic principle of this framework to perception-action systems with multiple information-processing nodes and derive bounded-optimal solutions. We show how the formation of abstractions and decision-making hierarchies depends on information-processing costs. We illustrate the theoretical ideas with example simulations and conclude by formalizing a mathematically unifying optimization principle that could potentially be extended to more complex systems.},

To explain the observed trends in the fitting errors, we present an argument about the conditioning of the Jacobian in the limit of small and large parameter values. We also demonstrate its use on an in vivo data set to measure performance on a realistic application. For a 192 × 192 breast image, we achieved run times of {\textless}1 s. Finally, we analyze run times scaling with problem size and find that the run time per voxel scales as O(N1.9), where N is the number of time points in the tissue concentration curve.

ToQ.jl leverages the metaprogramming facilities in Julia (a high-level, high-performance programming language for technical computing) and uses D-Wave's ToQ programming language as an intermediate representation. This makes it possible for a programmer to leverage all the capabilities of Julia, and the D-Wave machine is used as a co-processor. We demonstrate ToQ.jl via two applications: (1) a pedagogical example based on a map-coloring problem and (2) a linear least squares problem.

This is accomplished by utilizing low rank approximations for sparse representations of the bivariate kernels. The resulting system can be solved in O(m2n) operations using an adaptive QR factorization, where m is the bandwidth and n is the optimal number of unknowns needed to resolve the true solution. The complexity is reduced to O(mn) operations by pre-caching the QR factorization when the same operator is used for multiple right-hand sides. Stability is proved by showing that the resulting linear operator can be diagonally preconditioned to be a compact perturbation of the identity. Applications considered include the Faraday cage, and acoustic scattering for the Helmholtz and gravity Helmholtz equations, including spectrally accurate numerical evaluation of the far- and near-field solution. The Julia software package SingularIntegralEquations.jl implements our method with a convenient, user-friendly interface.},

Used by governments and other decision-makers in benefit–cost analysis for over a decade, SC-CO2 estimates draw on climate science, economics, demography and other disciplines. However, a 2017 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine1 (NASEM) highlighted that current SC-CO2 estimates no longer reflect the latest research. The report provided a series of recommendations for improving the scientific basis, transparency and uncertainty characterization of SC-CO2 estimates. Here we show that improved probabilistic socioeconomic projections, climate models, damage functions, and discounting methods that collectively reflect theoretically consistent valuation of risk, substantially increase estimates of the SC-CO2. Our preferred mean SC-CO2 estimate is \$185 per tonne of CO2 (\$44–\$413 per tCO2: 5\%–95\% range, 2020 US dollars) at a near-term risk-free discount rate of 2\%, a value 3.6 times higher than the US government’s current value of \$51 per tCO2. Our estimates incorporate updated scientific understanding throughout all components of SC-CO2 estimation in the new open-source Greenhouse Gas Impact Value Estimator (GIVE) model, in a manner fully responsive to the near-term NASEM recommendations. Our higher SC-CO2 values, compared with estimates currently used in policy evaluation, substantially increase the estimated benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation and thereby increase the expected net benefits of more stringent climate policies.},

  abstract   = {Background By July 14, 2021, 81·3 \% of adults (aged ≥18 years) in Chile had received a first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and 72·3\% had received a second SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, with the majority of people given Sinovac's inactivated CoronaVac vaccine (75·3\% of vaccines dispensed) or Pfizer–BioNTech's mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine (20·9\% of vaccines dispensed). Due to the absence of simultaneous real-world data for these vaccines, we aimed to compare SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity between vaccines using a dynamic national monitoring strategy. Methods From March 12, 2021, 28 testing stations for SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection were installed in hotspots based on cellular-phone mobility tracking within the most populated cities in Chile. Individuals voluntarily approaching the testing stations were invited to do a lateral flow test by finger prick and respond to a questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics, vaccination status (including type of vaccine if one was received), variables associated with SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and comorbidities. We compared the proportion of individuals testing positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG across sites by week since vaccination between recipients of CoronaVac and BNT162b2. Unvaccinated participants served as a control population and were matched to vaccinated individuals on the basis of date of presentation to the testing station, gender, and age group. Individuals were excluded from the analysis if they were younger than 18 years, had no declared gender, had an invalid IgG test result, had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on PCR, could not recall their vaccination status, or had been immunised against COVID-19 with vaccines other than CoronaVac or BNT162b2. Here, we report data collected up to July 2, 2021. Findings Of 64 813 individuals enrolled, 56 261 were included in the final analysis, of whom 33 533 (59·6\%) had received at least one dose of the CoronaVac vaccine, 8947 (15·9\%) had received at least one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, and 13 781 (24·5\%) had not received a vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity during week 4 after the first dose of CoronaVac was 28·1\% (95\% CI 25·0–31·2; 220 of 783 individuals), reaching a peak of 77·4\% (75·5–79·3; 1473 of 1902 individuals) during week 3 after the second dose. SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity during week 4 after the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine was 79·4\% (75·7–83·1; 367 of 462 individuals), increasing to 96·5\% (94·9–98·1; 497 of 515 individuals) during week 3 after the second dose and remaining above 92\% until the end of the study. For unvaccinated individuals, IgG seropositivity ranged from 6·0\% (4·4–7·6; 49 of 810 individuals) to 18·7\% (12·5–24·9; 28 of 150 individuals) during the 5 month period. Regression analyses showed that IgG seropositivity was significantly lower in men than women and in people with diabetes or chronic diseases for CoronaVac vaccine recipients (p{\textless}0·0001), and for individuals aged 60 years and older compared with people aged 18–39 years for both vaccines (p{\textless}0·0001), 3–16 weeks after the second dose. Interpretation IgG seropositivity was lower after CoronaVac than after BNT162b2 and declined over time since vaccination for CoronaVac recipients but not BNT162b2 recipients. Prolonged IgG monitoring will allow further evaluation of seropositivity overtime, providing data, in conjunction with effectiveness studies, for possible future re-assessment of vaccination strategies.

Theory suggests that avoidance in anxiety disorders may reflect dysregulated mental simulation, a process for evaluating candidate actions. If so, these covert processes should have observable consequences: choices reflecting increased and biased deliberation. In two online general population samples, we examined how self-report symptoms of social anxiety disorder predict choices in a socially framed reinforcement learning task, the patent race, in which the pattern of choices reflects the content of deliberation. Using a computational model to assess learning strategy, we found that self-report social anxiety was indeed associated with increased deliberative evaluation. This effect was stronger for a particular subset of feedback (‘upward counterfactual’) in one of the experiments, broadly matching the biased content of rumination in social anxiety disorder, and robust to controlling for other psychiatric symptoms. These results suggest a grounding of symptoms of social anxiety disorder in more basic neuro-computational mechanisms.},

We introduce a general framework based on a list of properties (of the system and of the projection) that need to be verified so that we can take advantage of a so-called ``coarse-fine'' strategy. This strategy is a novel method in which we exploit information coming from a coarser approximation of the system to get useful information on a finer approximation, speeding up the computation. This coarse-fine strategy allows a precise estimation of invariant densities and also allows to estimate rigorously the speed of mixing of the system by the speed of mixing of a coarse approximation of it, which can easily be estimated by the computer. The estimates obtained here are rigourous, i.e., they come with exact error bounds that are guaranteed to hold and take into account both the discretiazation and the approximations induced by finite-precision arithmetic. We apply this framework to several discretization schemes and examples of invariant density computation from previous works, obtaining a remarkable reduction in computation time. We have implemented the numerical methods described here in the Julia programming language, and released our implementation publicly as a Julia package.},

  abstract  = {The aesthetic preferences of potential mates have driven the evolution of a baffling diversity of elaborate ornaments. Which fitness benefit—if any—choosers gain from expressing such preferences is controversial, however. Here, we simulate the evolution of preferences for multiple ornament types (e.g., “Fisherian,” “handicap,” and “indicator” ornaments) that differ in their associations with genes for attractiveness and other components of fitness. We model the costs of preference expression in a biologically plausible way, which decouples costly mate search from cost-free preferences. Ornaments of all types evolved in our model, but their occurrence was far from random. Females typically preferred ornaments that carried information about a male’s quality, defined here as his ability to acquire and metabolize resources. Highly salient ornaments, which key into preexisting perceptual biases, were also more likely to evolve. When males expressed quality-dependent ornaments, females invested readily in costly mate search to locate preferred males. In contrast, the genetic benefits associated with purely arbitrary ornaments were insufficient to sustain highly costly mate search. Arbitrary ornaments could nonetheless “piggyback” on mate-search effort favored by other, quality-dependent ornaments. We further show that the potential to produce attractive male offspring (“sexy sons”) can be as important as producing offspring of high general quality (“good genes”) in shaping female preferences, even when preferred ornaments are quality dependent. Our model highlights the importance of mate-search effort as a driver of aesthetic coevolution.},

We also present non-adiabatic couplings and diabatic couplings for these avoided crossing systems.

  abstract = {This thesis considers algorithmic and computational acceleration of numerical wave modelling at high frequencies. Numerical propagation of linear waves at high frequencies poses a significant challenge to modern simulation techniques. Despite the fact that potential practical benefits led a great deal of attention to this problem, current research has yet to provide a general and performant method to solve it. I consider finite element as a possible solution because it can handle geometric complexity of heterogeneous domains, but unfortunately it suffers from the “pollution” effect which imposes a prohobitively large memory requirement to handle high frequencies. One recent step towards enabling the finite element method to solve high frequency wave propagation in the frequency domain involves using a plane-wave basis rather than the standard polynomial basis. This allows highly compressed representations of scattering waves but otherwise appeared to limit users to nearly-homogeneous problems. This thesis explores the use of plane-waves in a discontinuous Galerkin method (PWDG) for highly heterogeneous problems possibly containing a point source. The low-memory nature of PWDG and the fact that its expressions can be computed in an entirely symbolic manner without quadratures furthermore permits an efficient graphics processing unit (GPU) implementation such that problems with very high frequencies can be solved on a single workstation. This thesis includes computational results demonstrating results for frequencies in excess of 100 hertz on the Marmousi model, solved using only a single GPU.},

However, for practical problems because the number of measurements is often large and the model parameters are also numerous, conventional methods for inverse modeling can be computationally expensive. We have developed a new, computationally efficient parallel Levenberg-Marquardt method for solving inverse modeling problems with a highly parameterized model space. Levenberg-Marquardt methods require the solution of a linear system of equations which can be prohibitively expensive to compute for moderate to large-scale problems. Our novel method projects the original linear problem down to a Krylov subspace such that the dimensionality of the problem can be significantly reduced. Furthermore, we store the Krylov subspace computed when using the first damping parameter and recycle the subspace for the subsequent damping parameters. The efficiency of our new inverse modeling algorithm is significantly improved using these computational techniques. We apply this new inverse modeling method to invert for random transmissivity fields in 2-D and a random hydraulic conductivity field in 3-D. Our algorithm is fast enough to solve for the distributed model parameters (transmissivity) in the model domain. The algorithm is coded in Julia and implemented in the MADS computational framework (http://mads.lanl.gov). By comparing with Levenberg-Marquardt methods using standard linear inversion techniques such as QR or SVD methods, our Levenberg-Marquardt method yields a speed-up ratio on the order of urn:x-wiley:00431397:media:wrcr22226:wrcr22226-math-0001 to urn:x-wiley:00431397:media:wrcr22226:wrcr22226-math-0002 in a multicore computational environment.

The essential idea is to apply regularity on the level lines of images, which is accomplished using functional lifting of the image gradient into a Radon measure in three-dimensional space Ω×S1, where Ω is the image domain, and the normals to the level lines are represented in S1. Utilizing the special structure of this higher-dimensional measure we propose a new discretization based on linear combinations of short line measures, and
present two efficient methods for numerically solving the resulting linear optimization problems.

Through various examples including deconvolution, binary segmentation, inpainting and a specialized noise removal we show the diversity of the framework and the effectiveness of the new discretization.},

The first main original contribution of this thesis consists of a semiparametric Bayesian model for waiting times between recurrent events. In particular, time-dependency of waiting times from the previous ones is modelled through mixtures of autoregressive processes. In addition, this model allows to create clusters of patients according to the entire trajectory of the event counts over the period of observation. Both fixed and time-dependent covariates can be introduced in the present framework. As the second main original contribution of this thesis, we derive the analytical expression of the full- conditional distributions necessary to build an MCMC algorithm to sample from the posterior distribution. The algorithm was efficiently coded in the Julia language. Data in this context usually consist of a large number of processes exhibiting a relatively small number of recurrent events, which is the typical situation arising in medical studies.

  abstract  = {Ensemble modeling is a well established approach for obtaining robust predictions and for simulating course grained population behavior in deterministic mathematical models. In this study, we present a multiobjective based technique to estimate model ensembles, the Pareto Optimal Ensemble Technique in the Julia programming language (JuPOETs). JuPOETs integrates simulated annealing with Pareto optimality to estimate parameter ensembles on or near the optimal tradeoff surface between competing training objectives. We demonstrated JuPOETs on a suite of multiobjective problems, including test functions with parameter bounds and system constraints as well as for the identification of a proof-of-concept biochemical model with four conflicting training objectives. JuPOETs identified optimal or near optimal solutions approximately six-fold faster than a corresponding implementation in Octave for the suite of test functions. For the proof-of-concept biochemical model, JuPOETs produced an ensemble of parameters that gave both the mean of the training data for conflicting data sets, while simultaneously estimating parameter sets that performed well on each of the individual objective functions. JuPOETs can be adapted to solve many problem types, including mixed binary and continuous variable types, bilevel optimization problems and constrained problems without altering the base algorithm.

There are many approaches to modeling the nature of this uncertainty, but this thesis focuses on developing new algorithms, software, and insights for an approach that has risen in popularity over the last 15 years: robust optimization (RO), and its extension to decision making across time, adaptive optimization (AO). In the first chapter, we perform a computational study of two approaches for solving RO problems: "reformulation" and "cutting planes". Our results provide useful evidence for what types of problems each method excels in. In the second chapter, we present and analyze a new algorithm for multistage AO problems with both integer and continuous recourse decisions. The algorithm operates by iteratively partitioning the problem's uncertainty set, using the approximate solution at each iteration. We show that it quickly produces high-quality solutions. In the third chapter, we propose an AO approach to a general version of the process flexibility design problem, whereby we must decide which factories produce which products. We demonstrate significant savings for the price of flexibility versus simple but popular designs in the literature. In the fourth chapter, we describe computationally practical methods for solving problems with "relative" RO objective functions. We use combinations of absolute and relative worst-case objective functions to find "Pareto-efficient" solutions that combine aspects of both. We demonstrate through three in-depth case studies that these solutions are intuitive and perform well in simulation. In the fifth chapter, we describe JuMPeR, a software package for modeling RO and AO problems that builds on the JuMP modeling language. It supports many features including automatic reformulation, cutting plane generation, linear decision rules, and general data-driven uncertainty sets.},

EMT is induced by soluble transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) family members, and restricted by vascular endothelial growth factor family members. While many downstream molecular regulators of EMT have been identified, these have been largely evaluated individually without considering potential crosstalk. In this study, we created an ensemble of dynamic mathematical models describing TGF-β induced EMT to better understand the operational hierarchy of this complex molecular program. We used ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the transcriptional and post-translational regulatory events driving EMT. Model parameters were estimated from multiple data sets using multiobjective optimization, in combination with cross-validation. TGF-β exposure drove the model population toward a mesenchymal phenotype, while an epithelial phenotype was enhanced following vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) exposure. Simulations predicted that the transcription factors phosphorylated SP1 and NFAT were master regulators promoting or inhibiting EMT, respectively. Surprisingly, simulations also predicted that a cellular population could exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity (characterized by a significant fraction of the population with both high epithelial and mesenchymal marker expression) if treated simultaneously with TGF-β and VEGF-A. We tested this prediction experimentally in both MCF10A and DLD1 cells and found that upwards of 45% of the cellular population acquired this hybrid state in the presence of both TGF-β and VEGF-A. We experimentally validated the predicted NFAT/Sp1 signaling axis for each phenotype response. Lastly, we found that cells in the hybrid state had significantly different functional behavior when compared to VEGF-A or TGF-β treatment alone. Together, these results establish a predictive mechanistic model of EMT susceptibility, and potentially reveal a novel signaling axis which regulates carcinoma progression through an EMT versus tubulogenesis response.},
