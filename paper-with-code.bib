  abstract  = {Estimation of parameters of a diffusion based on discrete time observations poses a difficult problem due to the lack of a closed form expression for the likelihood. From a Bayesian computational perspective it can be casted as a missing data problem where the diffusion bridges in between discrete-time observations are missing. The computational problem can then be dealt with using a Markov-chain Monte-Carlo method known as data-augmentation. If unknown parameters appear in the diffusion coefficient, direct implementation of data-augmentation results in a Markov chain that is reducible. Furthermore, data-augmentation requires efficient sampling of diffusion bridges, which can be difficult, especially in the multidimensional case. We present a general framework to deal with with these problems that does not rely on discretisation. The construction generalises previous approaches and sheds light on the assumptions necessary to make these approaches work. We define a random-walk type Metropolis-Hastings sampler for updating diffusion bridges. Our methods are illustrated using guided proposals for sampling diffusion bridges. These are Markov processes obtained by adding a guiding term to the drift of the diffusion. We give general guidelines on the construction of these proposals and introduce a time change and scaling of the guided proposal that reduces discretisation error. Numerical examples demonstrate the performance of our methods.},

In total, more than 1500 structures are generated and screened for effective diffusivity. We studied simple cubic and face-centered cubic lattices of spheres and cubes, random configurations of cubes and spheres as a function of volume fraction and polydispersity, and finally random configurations of ellipsoids and cuboids as a function of shape. We found some interesting shape-dependent differences in behavior, elucidating the impact of shape on the targeted design of granular materials.},

  abstract  = {Recently a new dimension of graphs has manifested in the network science community that goes beyond the traditional notion of connections and disconnections to include both favorable and adverse relationships. There are many applications, such as ranking and clustering, where data scientists are interested in solving linear systems associated with unsigned graphs. We show that there exists a direct relationship between a signed graph and an unsigned variant. Methods that have been applied for unsigned graphs could be applied to signed graphs in a meaningful way. Fairly robust solvers for unsigned, undirected graph Laplacians have been developed, but these solvers are not directly applicable to general, signed graphs. Gremban's expansion [K. Gremban, Combinatorial Preconditioners for Sparse, Symmetric, Diagonally Dominant Linear Systems, Ph.D. thesis and Tech. report CMU-CS-96-123, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, 1996] is used to transform the signed, undirected graph Laplacian into an unsigned, undirected graph Laplacian with twice the number of unknowns. The solution to the linear system of the expanded matrix yields the solution of the original linear system. Thus, using Gremban's expansion, we can extend the current Laplacian solvers' robustness to signed graph Laplacians. We hope to further motivate data analysts to use signed graph models by providing optimal solvers and showing how they are related to existing unsigned graph mining techniques applied to the graph associated with the Gremban's expansion matrix. Due to the relationship between a signed graph and its unsigned graph via the Gremban expansion matrix, we conduct a preliminary investigation into the application of traditional ranking to the Gremban's expansion matrix. The rankings using Gremban's expansion for a user-movie rating graph change considerably if a signed graph Laplacian is used, indicating that applications such as recommendation systems would attain different and possibly better recommendations if a signed graph was used instead. This paper delves into the numerical stability and applicability of Gremban's expansion and proves that the error of the solution of the original linear system can be tightly bounded by the error of the expanded system. Gremban's expansion was originally created only for symmetric matrices. This paper demonstrates that the expansion is applicable not only to symmetric diagonally dominant matrices but also to nonsymmetric matrices associated with signed, directed graphs. This paper presents numerical tests on signed, undirected graphs. Both manufactured and real-world signed, undirected graph Laplacians are tested with various solvers to show that the expansion is numerically stable.},

  abstract   = {Forward modeling is vital for 3D inversion and interpretation of electromagnetic (EM) data in anisotropic media, which is one of the major challenges in the field of EM geophysics. However, there are few freely available 3D codes that are capable of modeling EM responses in fully anisotropic media. In addition, most existing 3D EM codes are written in low-level languages (LLs) such as C and Fortran, making them difficult to read, maintain, and extend. Taking advantage of recent progress in computer technology and numerical methods, we have developed an open-source package for forward modeling of frequency-domain EM fields in a fully 3D anisotropic earth (EM3DANI) using the Julia language, a relatively young, high-level programming language with a focus on high performance. Based on a mimetic finite-volume discretization of the governing equations, the modeling algorithm is expressed in an abstract form in terms of matrices/vectors and thus can be easily implemented by using any high-level language commonly used for numerical computing. Existing libraries written in LLs can be easily integrated into a Julia code without the so-called two-language problem; thus, we have exploited several mature third-party packages to deal with computationally intensive parts of the forward modeling, which guarantees high stability and efficiency. We have elaborated the structure of the package, paying special attention to code usability, readability, and extendability, while striving to retain versatility and high performance. The effectiveness of the code is demonstrated through two 1D synthetic examples for magnetotelluric and controlled-source EM (CSEM) problems, respectively. High accuracy and efficiency can be achieved for both 1D examples. Furthermore, we have developed a 3D example mimicking a marine CSEM survey scenario for hydrocarbon exploration. The simulation results indicate that the effect of the anisotropy on forward responses is significant and can be comparable to that of the target reservoir.},
