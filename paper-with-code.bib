  abstract  = {Estimation of parameters of a diffusion based on discrete time observations poses a difficult problem due to the lack of a closed form expression for the likelihood. From a Bayesian computational perspective it can be casted as a missing data problem where the diffusion bridges in between discrete-time observations are missing. The computational problem can then be dealt with using a Markov-chain Monte-Carlo method known as data-augmentation. If unknown parameters appear in the diffusion coefficient, direct implementation of data-augmentation results in a Markov chain that is reducible. Furthermore, data-augmentation requires efficient sampling of diffusion bridges, which can be difficult, especially in the multidimensional case. We present a general framework to deal with with these problems that does not rely on discretisation. The construction generalises previous approaches and sheds light on the assumptions necessary to make these approaches work. We define a random-walk type Metropolis-Hastings sampler for updating diffusion bridges. Our methods are illustrated using guided proposals for sampling diffusion bridges. These are Markov processes obtained by adding a guiding term to the drift of the diffusion. We give general guidelines on the construction of these proposals and introduce a time change and scaling of the guided proposal that reduces discretisation error. Numerical examples demonstrate the performance of our methods.},

We present a free and open-source software system that aims to ease many of the tasks encountered during the planning phase, in the execution and in data treatment of experiments performed on neutron triple-axis spectrometers. The software is currently in use and has been successfully tested at the MLZ, but can be configured to work with other triple-axis instruments and instrument control systems.},

In total, more than 1500 structures are generated and screened for effective diffusivity. We studied simple cubic and face-centered cubic lattices of spheres and cubes, random configurations of cubes and spheres as a function of volume fraction and polydispersity, and finally random configurations of ellipsoids and cuboids as a function of shape. We found some interesting shape-dependent differences in behavior, elucidating the impact of shape on the targeted design of granular materials.},

  abstract  = {Recently a new dimension of graphs has manifested in the network science community that goes beyond the traditional notion of connections and disconnections to include both favorable and adverse relationships. There are many applications, such as ranking and clustering, where data scientists are interested in solving linear systems associated with unsigned graphs. We show that there exists a direct relationship between a signed graph and an unsigned variant. Methods that have been applied for unsigned graphs could be applied to signed graphs in a meaningful way. Fairly robust solvers for unsigned, undirected graph Laplacians have been developed, but these solvers are not directly applicable to general, signed graphs. Gremban's expansion [K. Gremban, Combinatorial Preconditioners for Sparse, Symmetric, Diagonally Dominant Linear Systems, Ph.D. thesis and Tech. report CMU-CS-96-123, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, 1996] is used to transform the signed, undirected graph Laplacian into an unsigned, undirected graph Laplacian with twice the number of unknowns. The solution to the linear system of the expanded matrix yields the solution of the original linear system. Thus, using Gremban's expansion, we can extend the current Laplacian solvers' robustness to signed graph Laplacians. We hope to further motivate data analysts to use signed graph models by providing optimal solvers and showing how they are related to existing unsigned graph mining techniques applied to the graph associated with the Gremban's expansion matrix. Due to the relationship between a signed graph and its unsigned graph via the Gremban expansion matrix, we conduct a preliminary investigation into the application of traditional ranking to the Gremban's expansion matrix. The rankings using Gremban's expansion for a user-movie rating graph change considerably if a signed graph Laplacian is used, indicating that applications such as recommendation systems would attain different and possibly better recommendations if a signed graph was used instead. This paper delves into the numerical stability and applicability of Gremban's expansion and proves that the error of the solution of the original linear system can be tightly bounded by the error of the expanded system. Gremban's expansion was originally created only for symmetric matrices. This paper demonstrates that the expansion is applicable not only to symmetric diagonally dominant matrices but also to nonsymmetric matrices associated with signed, directed graphs. This paper presents numerical tests on signed, undirected graphs. Both manufactured and real-world signed, undirected graph Laplacians are tested with various solvers to show that the expansion is numerically stable.},

Streaming graph algorithms that avoid unnecessary recomputation through clever application of data dependency analysis are often more complex to derive than their static counterparts. This paper discusses a method to derive algorithms for streaming graph analysis from static formulations Combining tuned graph algorithms building blocks with an appropriate functional language, a graph query planner should be able to correctly implement most static and streaming versions of an algorithm from a single mathematical formulation. We provide a detailed analysis for the case of updating triangle counts in a streaming graph using linear algebra and an experimental evaluation in Julia.},
